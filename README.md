# Lab 8: Using an LLM API

This lab demonstrates how to use the Mistral API to carry out NLP tasks. This lab is due Sunday, April 6, 11:59pm EDT.

**Important Note: Please keep all of your output visible so that the TAs do not need to re-run your code and waste a lot of GPU time. As you've seen Google will cut off your GPU access if you use too much. The TAs need to be able to grade your code without running it.**

### Overview 
1. Clone the lab repo down to your own machine.
2. Complete the lab in the Colab notebook, as described below in Parts 1 and 2. 
3. Share your Colab notebook with me and the TAs, as described in the notebook.
4. Download, add, commit, and push your notebook to your repo. 


### Part 1: Getting your own copy of the Colab notebook.

[Here's a link to the Colab notebook for lab 8](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lb0X15kmz1ZkT6gJ65o6Wmm6EdeSNynj?usp=sharing). Remember you need to save a copy in your drive to start editing!


### Part 2: Complete the Colab notebooak
* Follow the instructions in the [Colab notebook for Lab 7](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lb0X15kmz1ZkT6gJ65o6Wmm6EdeSNynj?usp=sharing) to create your own copy of the notebook.
* Edit the Colab notebook to complete the various tasks, as indicated in the notebook. Most of the time this will involve writing code in a code cell, but sometimes you will answer questions in a text cell. It will always be clear what you have to do.

### Part 3: Submit your work
* Run the whole notebook from the beginning (`Runtime->Run all`). Make sure all your output is visible!
* Share the notebook with me and the TAs, as decribed in the notebook.
* Download your Colab notebook to your computer, move it into this repository, and add, commit, and push it to GitHub, just like you did for prior labs.
* **Do not alter the Colab notebook after the deadline.** If you do -- even just to fix a typo! -- it will look like you turned the notebook in late. If you happen to do it, let the TAs know so they can refer to the version you submitted to GitHub instead.
